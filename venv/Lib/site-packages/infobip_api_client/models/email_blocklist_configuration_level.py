    Defines the level at which Infobip stores unsubscribe preferences.  Note: When you change the unsubscribe configuration from a more global level (such as FROM_DOMAIN) to a more specific level (such as FROM_SENDER), remember that anyone who previously unsubscribed at the domain level chose to stop receiving all messages from your domain. These existing unsubscribe records will not automatically update to reflect the new sender-level setting. As a result, individuals who unsubscribed from your domain will continue to not receive messages, even after the change. To prevent confusion and respect user preferences, carefully manage and, if necessary, update these records when altering unsubscribe settings.
